    it seems tests passed on macos and linux runners, but failed on windows runners. refer to ~/Downloads/1.png for more info

    I see the issue! The Windows test is failing with an import error because it can't find the `curses` module. The error shows:

    ```
    ERROR collecting tests/test_cligent_integration.py
    ImportError while importing test module 'D:\a\tigs\tigs\python\tests\test_cligent_integration.py'.
    ...
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_curses'
    ```

    This is a common issue - the `curses` library is not available on Windows by default. The problem is that our code imports `curses` directly in several places, and when the tests try to import these modules on Windows, they fail.

    The solution is to make curses imports conditional and provide fallback behavior for Windows. Let me check where curses is being imported:

    The issue is that both source files and test files are importing curses directly. For a quick fix, I need to make curses imports conditional. Let me first check how curses is being used in the test files:

    Let me check specifically in the files that showed up in the import search:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:41:38Z'

    Now I understand the problem. The tests are using `curses.KEY_UP`, `curses.KEY_DOWN`, etc. I need to create a Windows-compatible approach. The best solution is to:

    1. Create conditional imports that work on both Windows and Unix
    2. Define fallback constants for Windows

    First, let me check if there's already a pattern for handling this in the codebase:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:41:51Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Perfect! There's already a pattern established in `src/tui/__init__.py` with `CURSES_AVAILABLE`. Now I need to fix the test files to use a similar approach. Let me create a test utilities module for Windows compatibility:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:41:58Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now I need to update the test files to use this utility instead of importing curses directly. Let me start with the visual selection test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:42:05Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now I need to replace the curses.KEY_* references with the imported constants:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:42:15Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now let me check the other test files that need similar fixes:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:42:32Z'
- role: assistant

    Let me check the actual content:

    wait, curses is the core library used in Tigs right?
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:43:17Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Yes, you're absolutely right! `curses` is indeed the core library used in Tigs for the Terminal User Interface (TUI). Looking at the codebase, curses is essential for:

    - Creating the terminal-based user interface
    - Handling keyboard input (arrow keys, etc.)
    - Drawing panes and managing screen layout
    - Color support in the terminal

    The issue is that the **tests** are trying to import curses on Windows, but curses isn't available on Windows by default. However, the tests don't actually need to run the full TUI - they're just testing the logic and using curses constants like `KEY_UP`, `KEY_DOWN` for mocking input.

    So the better approach would be to:

    1. **Skip TUI-related tests on Windows** where curses isn't available, OR
    2. **Mock curses entirely in tests** so they can run on Windows without needing the actual curses library

    The application itself is meant to run on Unix/Linux/macOS where curses is available. Windows users wouldn't normally run the TUI version anyway.

    Would you prefer me to:
    1. Skip the failing tests on Windows using pytest markers, or
    2. Mock curses more comprehensively in tests so they can run on Windows?

    This way the core functionality remains intact while making the test suite more portable.

    so looks like Tigs simple won't work on windows machines?
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:43:46Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Correct! Tigs won't work on Windows machines because:

    1. **Curses dependency**: The entire TUI (Terminal User Interface) is built on the `curses` library, which is not available on Windows by default
    2. **Unix-focused design**: The application is designed for Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) where curses is a standard library

    However, there are a few potential paths:

    ## Current Reality
    - **Linux/macOS**: Full functionality ✅
    - **Windows**: Won't run ❌

    ## Possible Windows Solutions (if desired in the future)
    1. **Windows curses alternatives**: Libraries like `windows-curses` or `blessed` could potentially make it work
    2. **Cross-platform TUI libraries**: Could rewrite using libraries like `rich` or `textual` that work on Windows
    3. **CLI-only mode**: Could provide a non-interactive CLI interface for Windows users

    ## For the CI/Tests Issue
    The immediate problem is that **GitHub Actions is trying to run tests on Windows**, even though the app won't work there. The best solution is probably to:

    - **Skip Windows CI entirely** for this project, OR
    - **Skip TUI-related tests on Windows** but still run other non-TUI tests

    Since Tigs is fundamentally a Unix/Linux tool (like many Git-related terminal tools), it's reasonable to only support and test on Unix-like platforms.

    Would you like me to:
    1. Configure the GitHub Actions to skip Windows entirely, or
    2. Add pytest markers to skip TUI tests on Windows but allow other tests to run?

    in that case, simple remove the windows test part from ci.yml
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:44:18Z'

    You're right! Since Tigs fundamentally won't work on Windows due to curses dependency, the simplest solution is to remove Windows from the CI pipeline entirely.

    Let me find and update the CI configuration file:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:44:28Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    I can see that the CI is already aware of Windows issues (there's a comment on line 59: "Windows has issues with some terminal-related dependencies") and there's already a partial exclusion for Python 3.8 on Windows. Let me remove Windows entirely from the test matrix:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:44:48Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now I should also remove the Windows-specific system dependency steps since they're no longer needed:

    Let me clean up the extra blank line:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:45:04Z'
- role: assistant

    Now let me also remove the test utility file I created since we're not going the cross-platform route:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:45:09Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    And revert the changes I made to the test files since they don't need to be Windows-compatible:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:45:15Z'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Good, that one was already correct. Now let me commit these changes:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:45:52Z'
- role: assistant

    Perfect! Now let me clean up the todo list and verify the final state:

    ## Summary

    I've successfully resolved the Windows CI failure by removing Windows from the GitHub Actions test matrix. Here's what was done:

    ### ✅ **Root Cause Analysis**
    - **Issue**: Windows tests were failing because `curses` library is not available on Windows
    - **Reality**: Tigs is fundamentally a Unix/Linux terminal application that requires curses for its TUI functionality

    ### ✅ **Solution Applied**
    - **Removed Windows entirely** from the CI test matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
    - **Cleaned up Windows-specific steps** that are no longer needed
    - **Maintained full test coverage** on supported platforms (Ubuntu and macOS)

    ### ✅ **Final State**
    - **CI now runs on**: Ubuntu + macOS across Python 3.8-3.12 ✅
    - **All linting checks pass**: Ruff linter and formatter ✅
    - **All tests pass**: 207 tests on supported platforms ✅
    - **No more Windows failures** since Windows is excluded ✅

    ### ✅ **Platform Support**
    - **Linux/macOS**: Full functionality with curses TUI ✅
    - **Windows**: Not supported (by design) - this is common for terminal-based Git tools

    The GitHub Actions should now pass successfully without the Windows compatibility issues, while maintaining comprehensive testing on the platforms where Tigs is intended to run.
