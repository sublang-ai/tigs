    Perfect! I've successfully:

    1. **Created a comprehensive e2e test** that validates the full workflow cycle:
       - Store chats in repo1 using `add-chat`
       - Push chats to remote with validation
       - Clone to repo2
       - Fetch chats in repo2
       - Verify chats are accessible
       - Test bidirectional sync

    2. **All tests pass**:
       - 7/7 CLI workflow tests pass (including the new e2e test)
       - The new test specifically validates the store → push → fetch → view cycle

    3. **Created PR #38** to close issue #37 with:
       - Clear description of the problem solved
       - Summary of all changes
       - Example of the improved error messages
       - Test results confirmation

    The e2e test ensures the complete workflow works correctly across multiple repositories sharing a common remote, which is exactly what you requested.
