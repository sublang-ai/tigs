    I've updated the release notes to accurately reflect what v0.1.1 actually contains - it's a massive update from v0.1.0! The release transforms Tigs from a basic CLI into a full-featured TUI application with:

    1. Complete TUI implementation with `tigs store` and `tigs view` commands
    2. 3-pane/3-column layouts with keyboard navigation
    3. Tig-style coloring throughout
    4. Claude logs integration
    5. Comprehensive E2E testing framework
    6. Major architectural improvements
    7. The push/fetch validation improvements

    This is essentially a complete rewrite/major feature release, not just a minor patch.
