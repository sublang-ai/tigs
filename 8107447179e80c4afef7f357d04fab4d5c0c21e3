    Currently in message panel, we use j,k for message navigations, up and down arrow keys for scrolling. We actually want j,k for scrolling, up and down keys for message navigations

    I need to swap the key bindings in the message panel. Let me look at the current implementation in the MessageView:

    Perfect! I can see the current implementation. Now I need to swap the key bindings:

    - Currently: Up/Down arrows = scrolling, j/k = message navigation
    - Desired: j/k = scrolling, Up/Down arrows = message navigation

    Now I need to update the help text in the status bar to reflect the new key bindings:

    Now let me reinstall to test the key binding changes:

    Perfect! The key bindings have been swapped successfully. Now in the message panel:

    - **Up/Down arrow keys** = Navigate between messages (jump to previous/next message)
    - **j/k keys** = Scroll line by line through the content
    - **Status bar shows**: `v2025-01-24-keys` and the help text correctly displays `↑/↓: jump messages | j/k: scroll`

    You can now test `tigs store` and the message panel navigation should work as desired!

    Perfect! The key binding swap has been committed. The commit message explains that the change makes the interface more intuitive by having arrow keys navigate between messages and vim keys handle scrolling, which aligns better with user expectations.
