    Now I have a complete understanding of the issue. Based on my research:

    1. **The issue**: Users don't know how to select items in `tigs store` because there's no instruction shown
    2. **The functionality exists**: Space key already toggles selection (line 156 in selection_mixin.py)
    3. **The problem**: The status bar only shows "Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit" but doesn't mention Space for selection
    4. **The solution**: Add Space key instruction to the status bar
