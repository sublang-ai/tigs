    I feel like the current way to highlight the active panel is not that clear. I always have a hard time figuring out which panel is the active one. Do you have any great ideas making the active panel stand out more clearly?

    Great point! The current focus indication is indeed subtle. Here are some ideas to make the active panel much more obvious:

    ## Visual Enhancement Options:

    1. **Colored borders**: Make the active panel's border a bright color (cyan/green) while inactive panels stay dim
    2. **Double-line borders**: Use `╔═══╗` style borders for active panel vs `┌───┐` for inactive
    3. **Panel title highlighting**: Make the active panel's title bold/colored (e.g., "**Messages**" vs "Messages")
    4. **Background tinting**: Subtle background color difference for the active panel
    5. **Arrow indicators**: Add `► Messages ◄` arrows around the active panel title
    6. **Inverted status bar**: Show active panel name in reverse video in the status bar

    ## My Recommendation:

    **Combine colored borders + highlighted titles** for maximum clarity:
    - Active panel: Bright cyan border + bold/colored title
    - Inactive panels: Dim gray border + normal title

    This would be immediately obvious which panel is active without being too distracting.

    ## Implementation:

    I could modify the `PaneRenderer.draw_pane()` method to:
    1. Use different border colors based on focus state
    2. Apply color/bold formatting to panel titles
    3. Maybe add a subtle indicator in the status bar showing current panel

    Would you like me to implement one of these approaches? Which visual style appeals to you most?

    I'll go with option 4. I like the idea

    Great choice! Background tinting will provide a clear visual distinction without being too aggressive. Let me implement this by modifying the PaneRenderer to apply a subtle background color to the active panel.

    sorry I changed my mind. I'll go with option 5

    Perfect! Option 5 with arrow indicators around the active panel title will be much more visually obvious. Let me implement that by modifying the PaneRenderer to add `► Title ◄` arrows around the focused panel's title.

    Perfect! Now let me reinstall to test the arrow indicators:

    Excellent! Now when you run `tigs store` or `tigs view`, you should see a clear visual distinction:

    - **Active panel**: `► Messages ◄` with bold borders
    - **Inactive panels**: `Messages` with normal borders

    The arrow indicators make it immediately obvious which panel is currently focused. You can use Tab to switch between panels and see the arrows move to indicate the active panel.

    This should solve your visibility issue! The arrow indicators provide a clear, unambiguous way to see which panel is currently active, making navigation much more intuitive.

    Perfect! The commit captures the visual enhancement that makes active panels much more obvious with the arrow indicators.
