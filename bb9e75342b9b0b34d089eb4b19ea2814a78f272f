    Based on my analysis, I can see the issue clearly:

    1. **In `tigs store`**: The commits view is colored properly because `store_app.py` (line 182) calls `commit_view.get_display_lines()` with the `colors_enabled` parameter.

    2. **In `tigs log`**: The commits view is NOT colored because `log_app.py` (line 143) calls `commit_view.get_display_lines()` WITHOUT the `colors_enabled` parameter.

    The `CommitView` class already has full color support implemented (as seen in `commits_view.py`), but `tigs log` isn't passing the `colors_enabled` flag to activate it.

    ## Summary

    I've successfully fixed the coloring issue in `tigs log` and added comprehensive test coverage:

    ### Changes Made:

    1. **Fixed log_app.py** (line 143): Added the missing `colors_enabled` parameter when calling `commit_view.get_display_lines()` to enable colored output in the commits view.

    2. **Created test_log_commits_colors.py**: Added 6 comprehensive tests that verify:
       - Colors are properly enabled/disabled based on the flag
       - Commit components (author, date, subject) receive appropriate colors
       - Read-only mode formatting (bullet points instead of checkboxes)
       - Commits with notes show star indicators
       - The log app correctly passes the colors flag to the commit view

    ### Test Results:
    ✅ All 6 new tests pass
    ✅ All existing log integration tests pass
    ✅ All existing commits view color tests pass

    The commits view in `tigs log` now displays with the same tig-style coloring as `tigs store`, with cyan for authors, blue for dates, and appropriate indicators for commits with notes.
