    I need to see the error image to understand what went wrong in the CI. Let me read the screenshot:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:07Z'

    I can see the CI error in the screenshot. The issue is in the test `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` at line 485 in `tests/cli/test_workflows.py`. The error shows:

    ```
    subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['git', 'push', '-u', 'origin', 'main']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
    ```

    This is a git push failure, likely because the test is trying to push to a remote repository that doesn't exist or isn't configured properly in the CI environment. Let me examine this test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:16Z'

    Let me look at the beginning of this test to understand the setup:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:21Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    I can see the issue. The test creates a bare repository and tries to push to it, but there's a problem with the git configuration or the initial branch name. In newer versions of Git, the default branch might not be `main`, or there might be issues with the bare repository setup.

    Let me check if this test was working before and see what might have changed:

    Let me look at the exact error message and check the git configuration in the test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:38Z'

    The issue is likely that when pushing to a bare repository, git needs to configure the default branch. Let me check the `create_test_repo` function to see how it sets up the branch:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:44Z'

    I can see the issue. The `create_test_repo` function doesn't set the default branch name explicitly. In newer versions of Git, the default branch might not be `main`. The solution is to explicitly configure the branch name or check what branch was created. Let me fix the test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:36:50Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    Now I need to also fix the references to `main` branch later in the test. Let me check if there are any more hardcoded `main` references:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:37:00Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    I need to fix all the hardcoded `main` references in this test file. Let me look at the other occurrences:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:37:06Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    I need to fix all the hardcoded `main` branch references. Let me update them systematically:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:37:19Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    Now I need to fix the remaining hardcoded `main` references:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:37:28Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now let me test the fix locally to make sure it works:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:37:42Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'
- role: assistant

    Let me fix the path and run the test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:38:11Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    Excellent! The test now passes. Let me update the todo list and run the other test in the same function to make sure I didn't break anything:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:38:22Z'
  log_uri: '7301ce82-6ee4-4314-ae50-05ad26249420'

    Perfect! Let me run all the CLI workflow tests to make sure everything is working:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:38:43Z'

    Excellent! All CLI workflow tests are now passing. Let me commit this fix:

    Perfect! I've successfully fixed the CI failure. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

    ## Issue Resolution: CI Test Failure

    **Problem**: The CI was failing on `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` due to git push failures when attempting to push to a bare repository.

    **Root Cause**: The test had hardcoded `main` branch references, but different Git versions may use different default branch names (`master`, `main`, etc.). Additionally, bare repositories need proper configuration to accept pushes.

    ### Key Fixes Applied:

    1. **Dynamic Branch Detection**:
       - Added `git branch --show-current` to detect the actual current branch name
       - Replaced all hardcoded `main` references with the detected branch name

    2. **Bare Repository Configuration**:
       - Added `git config receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore` to allow pushes to bare repositories
       - This prevents the "failed to push some refs" error

    3. **Cross-Version Compatibility**:
       - Tests now work regardless of Git's default branch name configuration
       - Compatible with both older Git versions (using `master`) and newer ones (using `main`)

    ### Test Results:
    - ✅ `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` now passes
    - ✅ `test_push_unpushed_commits_validation` continues to work
    - ✅ All CLI workflow tests pass (7/7)

    The fix ensures that the comprehensive CI pipeline will now run successfully without the git push failures that were blocking the workflow. The CI should now complete successfully with both the optimized test execution (no duplicate python test runs) and all tests passing.
