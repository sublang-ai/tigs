    Looking at the current CI configuration, I can see that there is indeed duplicate execution of the python tests. Let me examine both the `run_tests.sh` script and the CI workflow to understand what's happening.

    Now let me check the current CI configuration:
  timestamp: '2025-09-28T08:24:13Z'

    I can see the issue clearly now. The CI is indeed running python tests twice:

    1. **Line 87**: `./run_tests.sh` - This runs ALL tests including both `python/tests/` and `tests/` by default
    2. **Lines 92-93**: `uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term-missing` - This runs ONLY `python/tests/` again specifically for coverage

    This duplication is unnecessary. Let me modify the CI to integrate coverage generation into the comprehensive test run instead of running python tests separately.

    I'll modify `run_tests.sh` to support coverage generation and update the CI accordingly:

    Now I'll update the CI workflow to use the `--coverage` flag instead of running the separate coverage step:

    Perfect! Now I need to test this change to make sure it works correctly. Let me run the enhanced script with coverage to verify it works:

    I need to install uv first to test this. Let me install it:

    uv is already installed right?

    You're right, let me check if uv is already available:

    Great! Now let me test the enhanced script with the correct PATH:

    Perfect! The enhanced `run_tests.sh` script is working correctly with the `--coverage` flag. I can see that:

    1. **Python tests with coverage**: 206 passed, 1 skipped (3.19s) with coverage report generated
    2. **E2E tests**: All 92 tests passed (100% success rate)
    3. **Coverage file**: `coverage.xml` was generated in the python directory

    Now let me create a commit for this CI optimization:

    Perfect! I've successfully addressed the CI duplication issue by:

    ## Summary of Changes

    **Problem**: CI was running python tests twice - once in `run_tests.sh` and again separately for coverage generation.

    **Solution**: Enhanced `run_tests.sh` with a `--coverage` flag that integrates coverage generation into the comprehensive test run.

    ### Key Changes:

    1. **Enhanced `run_tests.sh`**:
       - Added `--coverage` flag support
       - When `--coverage` is used with python tests, runs python tests with coverage first, then E2E tests separately
       - Generates `coverage.xml` in the python directory as expected by CI

    2. **Updated CI workflow**:
       - Replaced separate coverage step with conditional logic in the main test step
       - For Python 3.11 on ubuntu-latest: runs `./run_tests.sh --coverage`
       - For all other matrix combinations: runs `./run_tests.sh` (no coverage)
       - Maintains existing coverage upload to Codecov

    ### Results:
    - ✅ **Eliminates duplicate test execution** - python tests now run only once
    - ✅ **Maintains 100% E2E test pass rate** (92/92 tests passing)
    - ✅ **Preserves coverage reporting** (206/207 python tests with coverage)
    - ✅ **Improves CI efficiency** - faster execution with cleaner logic

    The CI now runs tests comprehensively without duplication while maintaining all existing functionality including coverage reporting to Codecov.

    in CI, looks like after running run_tests.sh, we run python/tests/ again to create the coverage file. Is that necessary? I don't want python/tests/ checked twice
