# Tig - Talk in Git

Tig is a Git-based talk management system for software development.  
It captures and manages talks between human developers and AI — including prompts (contexts, instructions, queries, etc.) and responses of any format — as the medium to express software requirements, design, and implementation.  
Talk management in Tig encompasses the storage, retrieval, and comprehension of these talks.

The name "Tig" is "Git" spelled in reverse.
