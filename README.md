# Tigs - Talks in Git → Specs

[![Discord Chat](https://img.shields.io/discord/1382712250598690947?logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/Tv4EcTu5YX)

Tigs is a Git-based chat management system for "vibe coding"—the new generation of software development.
It captures and manages talks, or chats, between human developers and AI, including prompts (contexts, instructions, queries, etc.) and responses of any format.
Tigs' chat management encompasses the storage, retrieval, and comprehension of such conversations, which serve as the medium to express user requirements and software design.

"Tig" in the name is simply "git" spelled in reverse.

Linus coded Git. Now, let's talk about Tigs.

> Code is cheap. Show me the talk.

## Features

- **Stores selected chat history or summaries** to preserve the rationale behind code changes.
- **Transforms raw chats into well-defined specifications** of user requirements and software design.
- **Tracks revisions and evolution** of the specifications over time.
- **Links chats, specifications, and code** to help developers recall or better understand the software.

## Development

Tigs is developed in [this LLM-native way](https://github.com/welldefined-ai/sublang): its requirements and design are expressed through talks with an LLM and translated into code.

By bootstrapping itself, Tigs manages its own talks and defines its own specifications.

The software specifications are language-agnostic and can be translated into code in different programming languages.
Currently, we provide implementations in Python and Node.js.
