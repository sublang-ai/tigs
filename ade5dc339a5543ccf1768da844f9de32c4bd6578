    Let me check the new error screenshot:

    I can see the error from the screenshot. The test `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` is still failing, but now with a different error related to git configuration. The error message shows:

    ```
    Error: Failed to add chat: Author identity unknown

    Please tell me who you are.

    Run

      git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"

    to set your account's default identity.
    Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

    fatal: empty ident name (for <runner@runnervm3ublj.2bppliwegfzurh2vkhaobcxu2f.dx.internal.cloudapp.net>) not allowed
    ```

    The issue is that the git user configuration is missing in the second repository created in the test. Let me fix this:

    Let me find where repo2 is created to see the git configuration issue:

    I can see the issue! The problem is that `repo2_path` is created with `git clone` (line 572), but when you clone a repository, it doesn't automatically inherit the git user configuration from the original repository. The `create_test_repo` function sets up git user config, but a cloned repository doesn't get that configuration.

    Let me fix this by adding git user configuration after the clone:

    Now let me test this fix locally to make sure it works:

    Excellent! The test now passes. Let me update the todo and commit this fix:

    Perfect! I've successfully fixed the remaining CI error. Here's a summary of what was resolved:

    ## Final CI Fix: Git User Configuration

    **Problem**: The test `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` was failing with "Author identity unknown" error when trying to add chats to a cloned repository.

    **Root Cause**: When using `git clone` to create the second repository (`repo2_path`), the cloned repository doesn't inherit the git user configuration (user.email and user.name) from the original repository. The `create_test_repo` function sets up git user config, but cloned repositories start with blank configuration.

    **Solution**: Added explicit git user configuration after cloning:
    ```bash
    git config user.email "test@example.com"
    git config user.name "Test User"
    ```

    ### Results:
    - ✅ `test_full_e2e_store_push_pull_view_cycle` now passes completely
    - ✅ The test successfully demonstrates the full workflow: store → push → pull → view
    - ✅ Both repositories (original and cloned) now have proper git identity configuration

    ## Complete Status:
    1. ✅ **CI Optimization**: Eliminated duplicate python test execution
    2. ✅ **Git Push Fix**: Resolved hardcoded branch name issues for cross-version compatibility
    3. ✅ **Git Identity Fix**: Added proper user configuration for cloned repositories

    The CI pipeline should now run successfully with all tests passing and optimized execution (no duplicate test runs).
