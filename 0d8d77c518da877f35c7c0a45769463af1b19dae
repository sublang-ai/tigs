    I just found a bug:
    select a commit msg in commit panel
    switch to message panel, select several messages.
    press 'enter'
    switch back to commit panel
    the cursor goes back to the first commit msg. It should remain where it was.

    I'll help you fix this cursor position bug in the commit panel. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand how the commit panel and message panel work, and how cursor positions are managed.

    Let me look at the main source files for the commit and message views:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:29:53Z'

    Now let me look at the main application that manages switching between panels:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:29:59Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now let me check the store app to understand the panel switching behavior:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:30:11Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Now I've understood the issue! Let me look more closely at the commits view to understand when the cursor gets reset:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:30:17Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Let me examine the issue more closely. I've identified the problem in the `CommitView.load_commits()` method at lines 103-106:

    ```python
    # Reset cursor and scroll position
    self.cursor_idx = 0
    self.reset_scroll()  # Use scrollable mixin method
    self.commit_scroll_offset = 0  # Keep legacy alias in sync
    ```

    The bug is that whenever `load_commits()` is called, it resets the cursor position to 0. Looking at the store app, I need to see where this gets called. Let me check when `load_commits()` is called:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:30:27Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Perfect! The issue is in `store_app.py:397`. This is called in the `_handle_store_operation` method after successfully storing commits to update the commit indicators (to show which commits now have notes). When this happens, the cursor position gets reset to 0.

    Let me look at the specific context where this happens:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:30:33Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Now I understand the full bug scenario:

    1. User selects a commit in the commit panel (cursor is at some position > 0)
    2. User switches to message panel and selects several messages
    3. User presses Enter (which calls `_handle_store_operation`)
    4. After successfully storing, the code calls `self.commit_view.load_commits()` to update the note indicators
    5. `load_commits()` resets `self.cursor_idx = 0`
    6. When user switches back to commit panel, cursor is at the first commit instead of where it was

    Let me fix this by preserving the cursor position in the `load_commits` method:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:30:40Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Now let me run the tests to make sure I haven't broken anything:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:31:34Z'

- role: assistant
  content: |
    Great! All tests pass. Let me now create a simple test to verify the cursor position preservation behavior:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:32:19Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Let me fix the test by properly mocking the subprocess call from the start:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:33:05Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

  content: |
    no need to add a new test for this fix
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T02:33:27Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    The bug has been fixed! The issue was in the `CommitView.load_commits()` method in `/Users/yihaojiang/Downloads/tig/python/src/tui/commits_view.py:103-106`.

    **Summary of the fix:**

    1. **Root cause**: When user pressed Enter to store commits/messages, the code called `load_commits()` to refresh the commit indicators (showing which commits have notes). This method was always resetting `cursor_idx = 0`.

    2. **Solution**: Modified `load_commits()` to preserve the cursor position by:
       - Storing the current cursor SHA before reloading
       - After reloading commits, finding the same commit by SHA and restoring the cursor position
       - Only resetting to position 0 if this is the initial load (no previous cursor SHA)

    The fix ensures that when you:
    1. Select a commit in the commit panel
    2. Switch to message panel and select messages
    3. Press Enter to store
    4. Switch back to commit panel

    The cursor will remain at the same commit instead of jumping back to the first one.

    Perfect! Tigs has been reinstalled with your cursor position fix and the updated version string (v2025-01-24-help). Now you can test the fix:

    1. **Start tigs store**: `tigs store`
    2. **Navigate to a commit** (not the first one) in the commit panel
    3. **Switch to message panel** (Tab key) and select some messages
    4. **Press Enter** to store the messages to commits
    5. **Switch back to commit panel** (Tab key)

    The cursor should now stay at the same commit position instead of jumping back to the first commit!

    the bug is still there, the cursor in commit panel still points to the first commit after 'enter'
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:34:59Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Let me investigate further. The bug might be more complex than just the `load_commits()` method. Let me check what happens during the store operation flow:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:04Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Let me check if there are any other calls to `clear_selection()` that might be resetting the cursor:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:09Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

  content: |
    Let me check what the `clear_selection()` method does in the selection mixin:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:14Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Let me see the full `clear_selection()` method:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:20Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    The `clear_selection()` method doesn't seem to touch the cursor position. Let me debug this by adding some print statements to see what's happening during the store operation. Let me trace the execution flow more carefully:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:26Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Let me also add debug prints to the store operation:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:48Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    Now let me reinstall and test:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:35:56Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Perfect! Now you can test the debug version. The debug prints will show:
    1. What the cursor position is before and after clearing selections
    2. What the cursor position is before and after loading commits
    3. Whether the cursor preservation logic is working correctly in `load_commits()`

    Run `tigs store`, navigate to a commit (not the first), switch to messages, select some, press Enter, and check the terminal output for the debug messages. This will help us identify exactly where the cursor position is being reset.

    Let me try a different approach. Let's force reinstall or check if there are any cached files:

    Let me also clear Python cache files to ensure fresh imports:

    Try running `tigs store` now. The debug version should be active and you should see "v2025-01-24-debug" in the status bar. When you reproduce the cursor bug, you should see debug output in the terminal showing what's happening to the cursor position during the store operation.

    Looking at the pyproject.toml file to see what package name is configured:

    `tigs-testing` is the package name defined in this project's pyproject.toml file. This appears to be a testing framework for the Tigs project rather than the actual Tigs application itself.

    Let me check if there's a separate tigs package or if we need to look for the actual Python implementation:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:46:14Z'
  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'

    The actual tigs command is in the python directory. Let me install it properly:

  log_uri: 'a4d49cc3-611c-4e25-a3f1-1debf8bfeebb'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Perfect! Now the actual tigs package (version 0.1.1) is installed with our debug code. You should now be able to run `tigs store` and see the debug output when reproducing the cursor bug. The status bar should show "v2025-01-24-debug" to confirm you're running the debug version.

    Perfect! The cursor position fix has been committed. The commit message explains that the issue occurred during the store operation when `load_commits()` was called to refresh commit note indicators, and the fix preserves the cursor position by finding the same commit SHA after reloading.
