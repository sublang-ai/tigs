    I can see the issue! The GitHub Actions "Run Ruff formatter check" step is failing because ruff detected that many files need formatting. The output shows:

    ```
    Would reformat: src/tui/__init__.py
    Would reformat: tests/__init__.py
    Would reformat: tests/conftest.py
    [... many more files ...]
    25 files would be reformatted, 19 files already formatted
    Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
    ```

    The issue is that when I ran `ruff format` earlier, it formatted the files, but I didn't commit those formatting changes. The GitHub Action is running `ruff format --check` which fails if any files need reformatting.

    Let me run ruff format again and commit the formatting changes:

    Perfect! The formatting has been applied. Now let me check the git status and commit these changes:

    Let me verify that ruff format check now passes:

    Perfect! Now let me also verify that all the linting checks pass:

    Excellent! Let me run the tests one more time to ensure everything is working correctly:
