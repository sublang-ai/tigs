    Perfect! I've updated the Python README to:

    1. **Focus on TUI commands first** - `tigs store` and `tigs view` are now presented as the primary interface
    2. **Added detailed TUI descriptions** - Including keyboard shortcuts and layout information
    3. **Updated sync commands** - Now showing the new `push` and `fetch` commands with validation
    4. **Repositioned low-level commands** - These are now in a secondary section for automation/scripting
    5. **Added architecture section** - Explaining the layer separation
    6. **Updated development section** - Including test suite organization
    7. **Enhanced Python API examples** - Including the new `push_chats()` method with validation

    The documentation now properly reflects that Tigs is primarily an interactive TUI application, with the low-level commands available for automation when needed.
