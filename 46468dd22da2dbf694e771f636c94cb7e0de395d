    another thing I just realized. looks like user can use down key to scroll down infinitely. This doesn't make much sense. Once there's no content downside the current screen, they shouldn't be able to scroll down any more

    You're absolutely right! That's a bug - users shouldn't be able to scroll down infinitely when there's no more content. Let me fix this by adding a check to prevent scrolling past the end of the content.

    The issue is in the down arrow handling where I just increment `_scroll_offset` without checking if there's more content below. Let me fix this:

    I need to add logic to calculate the total content height and prevent scrolling past it. The issue is that I need to know the total number of lines in the content to set a proper limit. Let me modify the down arrow logic:

    Now I need to implement the `_calculate_total_content_lines` method that counts all the lines that would be generated:

    Now let me update the debug info and reinstall:

    Perfect! I've fixed the infinite down scrolling bug. Here's what I implemented:

    **The Problem:** Users could scroll down infinitely even when there was no more content below the current viewport.

    **The Solution:**
    1. **New `_calculate_total_content_lines()` method** that calculates exactly how many lines the entire content would take (including headers, wrapped content lines, and separators)

    2. **Enhanced down arrow logic** that:
       - Calculates total content lines using the current width
       - Calculates viewport height (content_height = pane_height - 3 for borders/footer)
       - Only allows scrolling down if `scroll_offset + viewport_height < total_lines`
       - This ensures there's always content below the current viewport when scrolling

    **Key improvements:**
    - **Prevents infinite scrolling** - down arrow stops working when you've reached the end
    - **Accurate line counting** - accounts for word wrapping, message headers, separators, and visual mode indicators
    - **Maintains responsive behavior** - calculation is fast and done per keypress

    **Debug info updated** to `v2024-09-24-scroll-limit` so you can verify you're running the latest version.

    Now the scrolling behavior is much more intuitive - you can scroll down until you see all the content, but no further!

    Perfect! I've successfully created a commit for the infinite scrolling fix:

    **Commit Summary:**
    - **Type**: `fix:` - Bug fix for infinite scrolling issue
    - **Scope**: Message panel down scrolling behavior
    - **Files changed**: 2 files (messages_view.py and store_app.py)
    - **Stats**: 44 insertions, 4 deletions

    **Key improvements documented:**
    - **Problem solved**: Prevents users from scrolling past end of content
    - **Technical implementation**: Added `_calculate_total_content_lines()` method for accurate boundary detection
    - **User benefit**: More intuitive scrolling that stops at actual content end
    - **Boundary logic**: Down arrow only works when there's content below current viewport

    The commit follows the project's established patterns with a clear "fix:" prefix and detailed explanation of both the problem and solution. The changes are now committed to the `fix-scrolling` branch.
