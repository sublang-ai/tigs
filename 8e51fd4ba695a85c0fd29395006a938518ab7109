    Great idea! Let me add contextual help information to the status bar when the message panel is focused.

    I need to modify the `_draw_status_bar` method in the store app to show different help text based on which pane is focused. Let me examine the current status bar logic:

    Now I need to implement the `_get_contextual_help` method that returns different help text based on which pane is focused:

    Perfect! I've implemented contextual help in the status bar. Here's what I added:

    **New `_get_contextual_help()` method** that returns different help text based on `self.focused_pane`:

    1. **Commits pane (0)**: `"Space: select | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit | v2024-09-24-help"`
    2. **Messages pane (1)**: `"Space: select | j/k: jump messages | ↑/↓: scroll | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit | v2024-09-24-help"`
    3. **Logs pane (2)**: `"↑/↓: navigate | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit | v2024-09-24-help"`

    **Key improvements:**
    - **Contextual guidance**: Shows relevant controls for each pane
    - **Message panel specific**: Clearly explains j/k for jumping between messages and ↑/↓ for scrolling
    - **Consistent base help**: Always shows Tab, Enter, q, and version info
    - **Dynamic updates**: Changes automatically when switching between panes

    **Debug version updated** to `v2024-09-24-help` so you can verify you're running the latest version.

    Now when users Tab into the message panel, they'll immediately see helpful guidance: `"Space: select | j/k: jump messages | ↑/↓: scroll | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit | v2024-09-24-help"`
