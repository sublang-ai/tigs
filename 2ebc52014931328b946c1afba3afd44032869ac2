    Ah, you're right! I only ran ruff on the `src/` directory, but GitHub Actions likely runs it on the entire codebase including `tests/`. Let me check the tests directory:

    You're absolutely right! There are 48 linting issues in the tests directory. Let me fix them:

    I'll continue fixing the remaining 7 manual linting issues in the tests directory. Let me address each one:

    I don't see any unused variables in conftest.py. Let me check the specific ruff errors to see what needs to be fixed:

    Now let me run a final ruff check on the entire codebase to ensure all issues are resolved:

    Perfect! All linting issues have been resolved. Let me also run the tests to make sure all fixes are working correctly:

    Excellent! All tests are passing. Let me create a commit for these final linting fixes:
  timestamp: '2025-09-24T08:29:40Z'

    Perfect! All linting issues have been successfully resolved across the entire codebase. Let me clean up the todo list since all tasks are completed:

    ## Summary

    I have successfully completed fixing all remaining ruff linting issues in the tests directory:

    ### Fixed Issues:
    1. **tests/conftest.py**: Removed unused `result` variable assignment
    2. **tests/test_commit_details_colors_comprehensive.py**: Removed unused `found_long_file` variable
    3. **tests/test_commits_status_footer.py**: Removed unused `footer_found` variable
    4. **tests/test_messages_status_footer.py**: Removed unused `footer_found` variable
    5. **tests/test_store_integration.py**:
       - Removed unused `result` variable assignment
       - Fixed equality comparison to `True` (changed `== True` to implicit boolean check)
    6. **tests/test_view_integration.py**: Removed unused `key` variable

    ### Results:
    - ✅ **All ruff checks now pass** across the entire codebase
    - ✅ **All 207 tests continue to pass** after the fixes
    - ✅ **GitHub Actions should now pass** the linting checks
    - ✅ **Complete code quality compliance** achieved

    The codebase is now fully compliant with modern Python linting standards, maintaining code quality while ensuring all functionality remains intact.
