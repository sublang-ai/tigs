    current CI only covers /python/tests. There's actully a run_tests.sh under the root folder. Use that in CI to cover all tests

    I'll help you update the CI configuration to use the `run_tests.sh` script from the root folder instead of only covering `/python/tests`. Let me first examine the current CI setup and the test script.

    Now I'll update the CI configuration to use the `run_tests.sh` script from the root folder. I can see that the current CI only runs tests from the `python/tests/` directory, but the `run_tests.sh` script can run both Python tests (`python/tests/`) and E2E tests (`tests/`) comprehensively.

    Now I need to also update the coverage file path since we're no longer running from the python directory:

    I've successfully updated the CI configuration to use the `run_tests.sh` script from the root folder. Here are the key changes made:

    1. **Removed the Python-specific working directory** from the test job so it runs from the root
    2. **Added executable permissions** for `run_tests.sh` before running it
    3. **Updated the test step** to use `./run_tests.sh` instead of just running `python/tests/`
    4. **Fixed the coverage file path** to `./python/coverage.xml` since we're no longer in the python directory

    The `run_tests.sh` script will now run comprehensive tests covering:
    - Python tests (`python/tests/`)
    - E2E tests (`tests/`)
    - Any other test targets specified

    This provides much better test coverage than the previous CI configuration which only ran `/python/tests`.
