    ## Summary

    Yes, I've thoroughly checked and the renaming is complete:

    **Completed Renaming:**
    1. ✅ `SessionsView` → `LogsView` (class name)
    2. ✅ `sessions_view.py` → `logs_view.py` (module name)
    3. ✅ "Sessions" → "Logs" (UI header)
    4. ✅ `tests/store/sessions/` → `tests/store/logs/` (test directory)
    5. ✅ All test class names from `TestSession*` → `TestLog*`
    6. ✅ Internal variables: `session_width` → `log_pane_width`, `current_session_id` → `current_log_id`
    7. ✅ Documentation updated in `tests/README.md` and `specs/dev/testing.md`

    **Intentionally Kept:**
    - References to "session" in `python/tests/mock_sessions.py` - these are correct because they create mock Claude session files
    - References in git history/logs - these are historical

    The renaming from "sessions" to "logs" in the store command is now complete and consistent throughout the codebase.
