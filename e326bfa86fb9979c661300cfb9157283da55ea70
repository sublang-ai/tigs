    looks like in 'tigs store', we currently allow user choose more than one commit in the commit panel.

    I'll help you investigate the current behavior of the commit selection in the 'tigs store' functionality. Let me first explore the codebase to understand how commit selection is currently implemented.

    Now let me look at the commit view to understand how selection is implemented:

    Now let me look at the selection mixin to understand how multiple selection works:

    Based on my analysis of the code, you are correct. In the `tigs store` command, users can currently select more than one commit in the commit panel. Here's how the multiple selection functionality works:

    ## Current Multi-Selection Features in `tigs store`:

    1. **Individual Selection**: Users can press `Space` to toggle selection of individual commits at the cursor position (line 155-156 in selection_mixin.py)

    2. **Visual Mode Selection**: Users can press `v` to enter visual mode, then move the cursor and press `v` again to select a range of commits (lines 158-159, 105-115)

    3. **Select All**: Users can press `a` to select all visible commits (lines 164-165, 129-142)

    4. **Clear Selection**: Users can press `c` to clear all selections (lines 161-162)

    5. **Multiple Storage**: When Enter is pressed, the selected chat messages are stored to ALL selected commits (store_app.py:344, 366-384)

    ## Key Implementation Details:

    - The commit view uses `VisualSelectionMixin` (commits_view.py:15) which provides the multi-selection functionality
    - Selected commits are tracked in `self.selected_commits: Set[int]` (commits_view.py:33)
    - The `get_selected_shas()` method returns full SHAs of all selected commits (commits_view.py:396-406)
    - Visual indicators show selected commits with checkboxes `[x]` vs `[ ]` (selection_mixin.py:27-47)

    This multi-commit selection allows users to efficiently store the same chat conversation to multiple related commits at once, which can be useful for tracking context across a series of related changes.

    let's change that behavior, I want user only able to choose one single commit in the commit panel

    I'll help you change the behavior to only allow selecting a single commit in the commit panel. Let me modify the code to disable multi-selection functionality.

    Let me first modify the CommitView to disable the multi-selection functionality by overriding the selection input handling:

  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now I need to add the `handle_single_selection_input` method to replace the multi-selection functionality:
  timestamp: '2025-09-26T06:39:40Z'
  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'

    Now let me update the store operation to simplify it for single commit selection:
  timestamp: '2025-09-26T06:39:52Z'
  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now let me update the help text in the status bar to reflect the single selection mode:
  timestamp: '2025-09-26T06:40:20Z'
  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Now I need to update the visual mode handling in the commits view to remove the visual mode indicator since we're disabling multi-selection:
  timestamp: '2025-09-26T06:40:30Z'
  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'
- role: assistant
  content: |
    Let me also check if there are any remaining references to visual mode that need to be cleaned up. Let me look at the `_visible_commit_items` method:
  timestamp: '2025-09-26T06:40:37Z'
  log_uri: 'dff17c84-77e6-433f-9745-19f645ee8708'

    Perfect! I've successfully modified the `tigs store` command to only allow single commit selection. Here's a summary of the changes made:

    ## Changes Made:

    1. **Modified CommitView Selection Logic** (`commits_view.py`):
       - Replaced `handle_selection_input()` with `handle_single_selection_input()`
       - Space key now clears all previous selections and selects only the current commit
       - Disabled visual mode (v), select all (a), and other multi-selection features
       - Kept clear selection (c) functionality

    2. **Updated Store Operation** (`store_app.py`):
       - Simplified storage logic to work with single commit instead of multiple commits
       - Updated error messages from "No commits selected" to "No commit selected"
       - Removed loop-based storage and replaced with direct single commit storage
       - Simplified success/error message formatting

    3. **Updated UI Indicators**:
       - Removed visual mode indicator display
       - Updated help text to show "Space: select | c: clear" instead of multi-selection hints
       - Cleaned up visual mode references in height calculations

    ## New Behavior:

    - Users can now only select **one commit at a time**
    - Pressing `Space` on a commit will:
      - Clear any previously selected commit
      - Select the commit under the cursor
    - The `c` key still clears the selection
    - Visual mode (`v`), select all (`a`), and other multi-selection features are disabled
    - When storing with `Enter`, the selected messages will be stored to only the single selected commit

    The interface will now enforce single commit selection, making the workflow more focused and preventing accidental storage to multiple commits.

    Done! I've removed the 'c' key functionality for clearing selection. Now the only way to change the selection is by pressing `Space` on a different commit, which will automatically clear the previous selection and select the new one. The help text has also been updated to reflect this simpler interface.

    Perfect! I've successfully:

    1. Added `<debug_single_choose>` to the status bar next to "q: quit"
    2. Reinstalled tigs in development mode with all the single commit selection changes

    You can now test the new functionality with `tigs store`. The changes include:

    - **Single commit selection only** - Space key selects one commit at a time
    - **No clear selection key** - Only way to change selection is to select a different commit
    - **Debug tag visible** - Status bar shows `<debug_single_choose>`
    - **Simplified storage** - Enter stores messages to the single selected commit only

    The status bar will now show: `Space: select | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit | <debug_single_choose>` when the commits pane is focused.

    This test is specifically testing visual mode functionality, which we've disabled. Since we've changed the behavior to single selection only, I need to update this test to reflect the new behavior. Let me replace this test with one that tests the single selection behavior:

    Perfect! **All tests are now passing** (206 passed, 1 skipped).

    ## Summary of Changes Made:

    1. **Modified CommitView** (`commits_view.py`):
       - Replaced multi-selection with single selection only
       - Added `handle_single_selection_input()` method
       - Space key now clears previous selections and selects only current commit
       - Disabled visual mode and other multi-selection features

    2. **Updated Store Operation** (`store_app.py`):
       - Simplified to work with single commit instead of multiple
       - Updated error messages from "No commits selected" to "No commit selected"
       - Added debug tag `<debug_single_choose>` to status bar
       - Removed 'c' key from help text (clear selection)

    3. **Fixed Tests**:
       - Updated error message assertion in `test_store_integration.py`
       - Replaced visual selection test with single selection test in `test_visual_selection.py`

    4. **Final Results**:
       - ✅ All 206 tests passing, 1 skipped
       - ✅ Single commit selection enforced
       - ✅ Debug tag visible in status bar
       - ✅ Package properly installed and ready for testing

    You can now test the new single commit selection behavior with `tigs store` - it will only allow selecting one commit at a time and the debug tag will be visible in the status bar.

    - When messages pane is focused: `Space: select | ↑/↓: jump messages | j/k: scroll | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit`
    - When logs pane is focused: `↑/↓: navigate | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit`

    The single commit selection functionality is now fully implemented and ready for testing with a clean interface.
