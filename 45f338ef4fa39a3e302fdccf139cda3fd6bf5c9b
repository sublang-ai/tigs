    Perfect! Now when you run `tigs store` and load messages into the message panel for the first time, it should:

    1. **Position the cursor at the last message** instead of the first message
    2. **Scroll the view to show the last message** so it's visible on screen
    3. **Display `v2025-01-24-lastmsg`** in the status bar to confirm you're running the updated version

    This makes the message panel behavior more intuitive - when opening a conversation, you typically want to see the most recent messages first, similar to most chat applications.

    The TodoWrite tool hasn't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using the TodoWrite tool to track progress. Also consider cleaning up the todo list if has become stale and no longer matches what you are working on. Only use it if it's relevant to the current work. This is just a gentle reminder - ignore if not applicable.

    Perfect! The commit has been created with a clear message explaining that the message panel now positions the cursor at the last message by default and scrolls to show it, providing better UX similar to modern chat applications.

    remove the | v2025-01-24-lastmsg info from the status bar

    Perfect! The version string has been removed from the status bar. Now the status bar will show clean help text without the debug version information:

    - **Commits pane**: `Space: select | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit`
    - **Messages pane**: `Space: select | ↑/↓: jump messages | j/k: scroll | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit`
    - **Logs pane**: `↑/↓: navigate | Tab: switch | Enter: store | q: quit`

    The interface is now clean and production-ready!

    also, when the log messages are loaded into the message panel for the first time, message panel should show the last message rather than the first message by default. The cursor should also point to the last message by default

    I need to modify the message loading behavior to start at the last message instead of the first. Let me look at the `load_messages` method and the initialization logic:

    I can see that at lines 95-96, it's setting `cursor_idx = 0` which makes it start at the first message. Let me also check the `_init_message_view` method:
  timestamp: '2025-09-25T04:58:58Z'

    Perfect! I can see the issue. Both `load_messages` and `_init_message_view` set the cursor to 0 (first message). I need to change these to position at the last message instead.

    However, I realize there's another issue. Setting `_scroll_offset = 0` means it will show the top of the conversation, even though the cursor is at the last message. I need to make sure it scrolls to show the last message. Let me add logic to scroll to the cursor position:

    Now let me update the version string and reinstall:
