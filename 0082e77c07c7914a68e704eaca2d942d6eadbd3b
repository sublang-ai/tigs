    Done! I've successfully implemented Issue #17 - Git notes storage integration. The implementation includes:

    1. **Enter key handler** - Validates selections and stores messages to commits
    2. **Message formatting** - Formats messages with role headers (User/Assistant)
    3. **Validation** - Ensures both commits and messages are selected
    4. **Overwrite handling** - Automatically overwrites existing notes
    5. **Status messages** - Shows confirmation like "Stored 2 messages â†’ 3 commits"
    6. **Indicator updates** - Reloads commits to update '*' indicators after storage
    7. **Selection clearing** - Clears all selections after successful storage
    8. **Unit tests** - Added comprehensive tests for the store operation

    The feature is ready to use - select commits with space, tab to messages, select messages with space, then press Enter to store them as git notes.
