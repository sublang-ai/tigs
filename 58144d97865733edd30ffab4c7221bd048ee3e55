    another issue. When user types 'tig store', the message panel should point to the first message, not the last message

    You're right! When users first open `tig store`, they should see the beginning of the conversation, not the end. Let me find where the initial positioning is set and fix it.

    Let me find where the initial cursor and scroll positioning is set:

    Let me look at the `_init_message_view` method:

    Found it! The issue is in lines 488-494 of the `_init_message_view` method. It's explicitly positioning to show the last messages and putting the cursor at the bottom. Let me fix this to start at the beginning:

    I should also check the other places where cursor is initialized to make sure they start at the beginning. Let me check the `load_messages` method:

    Good! The `load_messages` method is already setting the cursor to 0. Now let me update the debug info and reinstall:

    Perfect! I've fixed the initial positioning issue. Here's what I changed:

    **The Problem:** The `_init_message_view()` method was explicitly positioning to show the **last** messages and putting the cursor at the bottom of the visible area.

    **The Solution:** Modified the initialization logic in `/Users/yihaojiang/Downloads/tig/python/src/tui/messages_view.py:488-491` to:
    - Set `cursor_idx = 0` (first message)
    - Set `message_cursor_idx = 0` (keep legacy alias in sync)
    - Set `_scroll_offset = 0` (no initial scrolling)

    **Key changes:**
    - **Removed the "show last messages" logic** that was calculating `max(0, len(messages) - visible_items)`
    - **Removed the "cursor at bottom" logic** that was positioning the cursor at the end
    - **Simplified to start at the beginning** - cursor on first message, no scrolling offset

    **Debug info updated** to `v2024-09-24-start-first` so you can verify you're running the latest version.

    Now when you run `tig store`, the message panel will start at the first message of the conversation, which is much more intuitive for reviewing the chat history from the beginning!

    Perfect! I've successfully created a commit for the initial positioning fix:

    **Commit Summary:**
    - **Type**: `feat:` - New feature that improves user experience
    - **Scope**: Message panel initial positioning behavior
    - **Files changed**: 2 files (messages_view.py and store_app.py)
    - **Stats**: 6 insertions, 10 deletions (net simplification)

    **Key improvements documented:**
    - **UX improvement**: Start at beginning of conversations instead of end
    - **User benefit**: More intuitive experience when opening `tig store`
    - **Technical change**: Replace complex "show last messages" logic with simple initialization
    - **Simplification**: Reduced code complexity by removing positioning calculations

    The commit clearly explains both the user-facing benefit (better UX) and the technical implementation (simpler initialization logic). The changes are now committed to the `fix-scrolling` branch with a clean working tree.
